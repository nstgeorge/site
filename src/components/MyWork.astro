    <p>
        My name is <strong>Nate St George</strong>. I work for Xylem under the
        Sensus brand, building AutomationControl&mdash;a tool for automating
        electrical distribution, providing safer and more reliable service to
        millions of people&mdash;with a focus on
        <strong>frontend development and UX.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
        Previously, I worked at the Idaho Department of Fish & Game, where I
        contributed across the web stack to a scalable, intuitive Hunt Planner
        application, enabling Idaho's residents to better utilize the wealth of
        information available to them through the IDFG. Prior to that, I worked
        at Cognitics, where I was responsible for all UI/UX on one of the first
        <strong>truly secure on-premise AI platforms</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
        Beyond my regular work, I have been playing drums for
        <strong>{drumYears} years</strong>. This has included playing percussion
        in three musicals (one on stage, two in the pit), countless ensemble
        performances, and 8 years of marching. Now, I primarily play drum kit,
        and I remain connected to my time at Boise State University's Blue
        Thunder Marching Band as
        <strong>the band's photographer</strong>. I also continue to write
        music.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
        By combining my passions for music and video games, I have been lucky
        enough to have my music
        <strong>featured in multiple indie games</strong>. I am always honored
        when a developer hears what I create and decides it's what they need to
        execute their creative vision. I released my first album in 2016,
        <i>Journey</i>, and made it freely available to download and use in
        other creative works. If you use my music in your project, please let me
        know!
