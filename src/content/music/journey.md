Journey was my first release, written while in high school. It integrates many of the genres that have continued to influence my music, most heavily the soundtracks I loved in 2015-2016. This album was released with a permissive license, and tracks from this album have been used in at least one cyberpunk-themed indie game.

While I have released music after this that I think is much better, this album seems to be listened to by two people on Spotify regularly. Hello, my two fans!
